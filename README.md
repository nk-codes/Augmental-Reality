AZURE service used :- WEB APP
Explanation :- Azure Web Apps are Microsoft's offering to cloud to host web applications. It allows developers to focus on delivering business values rather than consuming time on Sever updates or OS patches. Interestingly, applications built on Java, PHP, Python or Node. js can also be deployed on web apps
